F2020-5,"Panamint Mountains, CA",Collected from a ~20 cm wide felsic segregation hosted in coarse-grained interior of diabase sill intruding near the contact of the argillite and cherty dolomite members of the Pahrump Group Crystal Spring Formation in Warm Spring Canyon of the Panamint Mountains,35.9623,-116.90123,1097.91,0.29,0.42,1.17,0.79,8
CS-4-GEOCHRON,"Panamint Mountains, CA",Collected from a 5 cm thick medium-grained felsic dike that is layer parallel to the strike of the host diabase sill 77 m from the base of the 101 m thick sill (Figure 1f). The sill intrudes the stromatolite member of the Crystal Spring Formation in Warm Spring Canyon of the Panamint Mountains at a stratigraphically higher position than the sill of sample F2020-5,35.96244,-116.88572,1098.27,0.27,0.41,1.16,0.35,9
CS-7-GEOCHRON,"Ibex Range, SE CA",Collected from a ~5 cm thick coarse-grained felsic dike that cuts obliquely through coarse-grained diabase within an approximately 100 m thick sill (Figure 1g). The sill intrudes the argillite member of the Crystal Springs Formation in the central Ibex Range.,35.81503,-116.38968,1098.09,0.91,0.96,1.45,1.57,4
MM2021-CA1,"Dead Mountains, SE CA","Collected from a felsic zone within subophitic interior of ~80 m thick diabase sill that is part of a suite of parallel, steeply- dipping, north-east striking sheets intruding ca. 1.4 Ga granite in the Dead Mountains, CA (Figure 1h, see also figure 4B of Howard, 1991).",35.08636,-114.75425,1082.6,0.3,0.43,1.16,1.53,8
MM21-R52-CB3Z,"Grand Canyon rm. 52, N AZ","Collected from a pegmatoidal interior of a 57 m thick Cardenas basalt lava flow at Nankoweap Canyon, Grand Canyon river mile 52 (Figure 1d). Zircon were extracted from this sample employing the bulk phenocryst dissolution methods of Oliveira et al. (2022), which yielded anhedral zircon microlites (<50 μm).",36.28344,-111.8926,1082.18,1.25,1.29,1.68,0.09,4
MS17-107-01,"Grand Canyon, rm. 107, N AZ","Collected from a 20 cm wide granophyre pod near the margin of a sill intruding the Bass Formation and Hakatai shale at Bass Canyon, river mile 107 (Figure 1c).",36.23335,-112.33145,1098.16,0.59,0.66,1.28,0.67,4
K12-132L,"Grand Canyon, rm. 132, N AZ",Collected from a 20 cm wide granophyre segregation within a ~50 m thick sill intruding the Bass Formation and Hakatai shale at GC river mile 132 (Figure 1b).,36.35093,-112.45621,1098.09,0.34,0.46,1.18,1.53,9
JT19-AA-01,"Salt River Canyon, central AZ","Collected from a ~10 cm wide portion of a subplanar vertical felsic dike within a subhorizonal diabase sill in Salt River Canyon, central Arizona (Fig. 1) that intrudes the Apache Group (Wrucke, 1990).",33.80767,-110.47423,1097.97,0.12,0.32,1.14,1.54,13
