I am here thanks to the opportunity to work with my advisor Nick Swanson-Hysell. I still remember our first contact via phone and the enthusiasm he expressed toward Earth history and magnetism as we discussed reconstructing a billion-year-old paleointensity records and building a prototype quantum diamond microscope. His drive toward open and reproducible science, putting questions into testable hypothesis, summarizing interpretations into succinct but informative words, and care for details in every aspect of the manuscripts constantly challenged me to be a better scholar. 

I thank my qualification exam committee, including Ben Gilbert, Harriet Lau, and Fernando Perez. I thank Bruce Buffett and Fernando Perez for being on my thesis committee and help me improve my dissertation. 

I thank my collaborators in research. Maggie Avery, Sarah Slotznick, Blake Hodgin, Tadesse Alemu, James Pierce, Anthony Fuentes, Jim Miller, Mark Schmitz, 


I thank my advisors for the courses where I taught as a graduate student instructor. I learned a lot about Berkeley local bedrock geology by teaching EPS 101 field geology and digital mapping with Nick Swanson-Hysell three times.  Our course in 2020 and the EPS 50 course with Professor Daniel Stolper taught me to stay positive and keep the enthusiasm about the outdoor and science while the world was at a lock down. I also appreciate the inspiring interactions with Professor Matthew Gleeson in the field as we together taught the field geology class in Fall 2023. 

Institute for Rock Magnetism. US Student Fellowship and summer school, and the opportunity to present my research at the 2023 IRM conference. I thank Bruce Moskowitz, Josh Feinberg, Peter Solheid, Mike Jackson, Maxwell Brown, Dario Bilardello for their patient education during my visits and knowledgable resource. 


I thank my office friends for always maintaining a lively atmosphere. They are Danielle Lindsay, 

I am also grateful for the company along the past five years from Nick's family. I have always enjoyed my time in the field together with Sarah, Maddy, and Wilma. I also thank Nick's parents, Tom Hysell and Susan Swanson for letting me stay at their house in January 2020 while I conducted experiments at the Institute for Rock Magnetism for a visiting student fellowship. I thank Ben and Ella Swanson-Hysell for the gatherings admist field seasons. 

Lastly and most importantly, I thank my parents for leading me a path to studying
