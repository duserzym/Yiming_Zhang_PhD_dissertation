Over 2000 years ago, one of humanity's earliest records of harnessing magnetism unfolded in ancient China, where lodestones (i.e. magnetic rocks) were used in telling directions in geomancy and divination practices. Compass made its way to Europe through the Silk Road, which granted European mariners the ability to tell their heading regardless of weather conditions or visibility constraints at sea. The improved navigation for mariners contributed to the Age of Discovery. Scientific advances through the centuries have made profound insights into the fundamental principles of electromagnetism. Today, our continued understanding and manipulation of the electromagnetic principles lie at the core of modern technology and life. 

It is because compass needles are made of magnetic materials that tend to align with Earth's magnetic field at surface which is dominantly dipolar and stable such that a compass can help navigate today. In the rock records, there are numerous microscopic compasses that are carrying ancient magnetic records through deep time. These microscopic compasses are magnetic minerals such as iron-titanium oxide minerals and iron sulfide minerals that occur rather ubiquitously in igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks. Through much of Earth's history, that a geodynamo that powered a strong magnetic field The study of paleomagnetism explores Earth history stories while being fundamentally rooted in the understanding of rock forming processes and the physics of magnetism.

In this dissertation, I find my applications of paleomagnetism in exploring the characteristics of magmatism in the Midcontinent Rift system in the Lake Superior region and in the southwestern Laurentia 1.1 billion years ago, shedding new lights in the strength of the geodynamo ca. 1092 million years ago, and furthering the development of global paleogeography through the end of the Mesoproterozoic to the earliest Neoproterozoic. 

\subsection{Late Mesoproterozoic magmatism in the Midcontinent Rift and the southwestern Laurentia large igneous province}

Laurentia craton assembled in the Paleoproterozoic through the trans-Hudson orogeny which stitched the cratons together, after millions of years of accretion events following the trans-hudson orogeny, the Midcontinent Rift began to develop in the interior of the craton. It has been hypothesized that the formation of the rift is associated with plume induced by slab break off underneath the Laurentia craton. This resulted in a large volume of magmatism that today we still can see in the magnetic and gravity anomaly that extends through the Lake Superior area and branches into Kansas and Michigan. A lack of clear Moho boundary has been interpreted to be caused by the underplated magmatic root that still exist today. 

However, the Midcontinent Rift failed to split the continent into two. This failure is associated with the onset and development of the Grenvillian orogeny that commenced along the eastern margin of Laurentia, whose far-field compressional force led to cessation of rifting and subsequently led to inversion of the rift. In the Lake Superior region today, large amount of rift rocks and post rift Meso- to Neoproterozoic sediments outcrop due to the development of the Lake Superior syncline as a result of rift-related normal fault system. In southern Lake Superior uplift Paleoproterozoic to Archean basement rocks are exposed due to the inversion of the rift. 

The intracontinental nature and the failure of the rift led to large amount of rift rocks being preserved in the interior of Laurentia, later being covered in Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks. Some are not exposed at the surface due the erosion associated with the erosion due to the Laurentide icesheet while in other areas the rocks remain buried. The mild thermal history of the MCR following its formation has left much of the rock record well-preserved. Rb-Sr dates from the uplifted basement rocks in southern Lake Superior region show that the area has not been heated to above 300 \textdegree C since ca. 1050 Ma. This is consistent with the paleomagnetic data from the MCR rocks showing minimal secondary overprints upon the primary directions. 

High-precision zircon U-Pb geochronology data developed through the method of chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectroscopy (CA-ID-TIMS) has revealed that the apparently protracted magmatism in the MCR is punctuated by rapid and voluminous magmatic episodes. In particular, geochronology data show that much of the 25 km thick mafic intrusive rocks of the Duluth Complex and the associated $\sim$8 km thick extrusive lava flows of the North Shore Volcanic Group formed within 500 Kyr \cite{Swanson-Hysell2021a}. That large volume of that episode of magmatism and the rapid emplacement tempo is consistent with the interpretation that the Duluth Complex and the associated lava flows being a large igneous province. Stratigraphically above the Duluth Complex, there lies the Beaver Bay Complex which is another mafic intrusive complex that extends from Silver Bay area to Grand Marais area in Minnesota, USA. The major unit of the complex is the Beaver River diabase is now tilted toward the lake, revealing wide magma conduits that contain anorthosite xenoliths that can be as much as 300 meters in width. Unlike the Duluth Complex and the North Shore Volcanic Group, whose magmatic linkage is supported by the direct spatial linkage and geochronologic data, the Beaver River diabase had not had well-constrained magmatic linkage drawn with any extrusive lava flows. A hypothesis posits that the Greenstone Flow of the Portage Lake Volcanics that outcrop in the upper Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan based on geochemical and petrographic similarities. In chapter 1, I further test this hypothesis by using paleomagnetic and geochronologic data to investigate the synchroneity of the emplacement of the intrusive and extrusive rocks. I show data that support that the Beaver River diabase was the feeder system for the $\sim$400 meters thick Greenstone Flow which ranks one of the largest lava flows known on Earth. The paleomagnetic and geochronologic data developed in that chapter show the the emplacement of the major mafic unit of the Beaver Bay Complex belongs to a distinct episode of magmatism in the Midcontinent Rift which is $\sim$4 Myr younger than the age of the Duluth Complex. 

While large igneous province style magmatism occurred in the Midcontinent Rift in the late Mesoproterozoic, rapid and voluminous mafic magmatism also occurred in southwestern Laurentia. Pioneering geologic observations first found that there are widespread mafic intrusions that intruded into sedimentary rocks in southwestern Laurentia. These mafic units include numerous thick diabase sills and dikes that intruded the Paleoproterozoic metamorphic rocks and the Mesoproterozoic Crystal Spring Formation in Death Valley, thick diabase sills within the Mesoproterozoic Unkar Group sedimentary rocks of the Grand Canyon, and the Mesoproterozoic Apache Group sedimentary rocks in central Arizona. At first they were broadly considered to be belong to the same magmatic province based on the stratigraphic context and regional proximity, and later broadly supported by low-precision geochronology data \cite{Bright2014a}. Recently collaborative work of \cite{Mohr2024a} which I was a part of used high-precision zircon CA-ID-TIMS data to show that there was a voluminous pulse of mafic magmatism featuring the emplacement of thick sills across at least eastern California to central Arizona during a briefly episode of $\sim$0.25 Myr ca. 1098 Ma. The volume and tempo of this magmatic event and the available geochemistry data are consistent with it being emplaced as a large igneous province related to upwelling of a mantle plume. In particular, \cite{Mohr2024a} invoked a tectonic model where a mantle plume  first arrived ca. 1098 Ma in southwestern Laurentia and laterally drained toward the readily thinned crust of the MCR and led to a replenishment of mafic magma which eventually contributed to the LIP-style emplacement of the Duluth Complex and the associated lava flows following a hiatus stage of magmatism in the MCR. In chapter 3 I develop new paleomagnetic data from southwestern Laurentia and update the extent of the southwestern large igneous province. 

In recently years, a wealth of high-quality paleomagnetic data and high-precision zircon CA-ID-TIMS dates have been paired and synthesized into an apparent polar wander path named the Keweenawan Track which delineates the recorded the progression of the paleomagnetic pole path ca. 1110 Ma to ca. 1080 Ma. Such records show rapid equatorial motion of Laurentia from high latitudes in the late Mesoproterozoic. Together with paleomagnetic data and geologic observations from conjugate continents, the Keweenawan Track records the assembly of an ancient super continent named Rodinia while Laurentia was the lower plate and eventually converged with Kalahari (ancient Africa) craton and Amazonia (ancient south America) craton. The rich paleomagnetic record has been central for paleogeography in the Mesoproterozoic. The new paleomagnetic data paired with high-precision geochronology in work presented in this dissertation further add to the paleomagnetic database for Laurentia, contribute to the improvement of the apparent polar wander path of Laurentia in the late Mesoproterozoic, and shed new light on the global paleogeography in the Neoproterozoic. 

\subsection{The geocentric axial-dipole hypothesis and Earth’s magnetic field in the late Mesoproterozoic}

It is the dipole hypothesis that grants power to paleomagnetic directional data for resolving temporal linkage between rocks. 

Ferromagnetic minerals in rocks can record Earth's magnetic field directions. In igneous rocks, minerals such as Fe-Ti oxides and Fe-sulfides can preferentially align with local Earth magnetic field directions during cooling through blocking temperatures. In sedimentary rocks, it is the preferential alignment of magnetic grains during settling and deposition that lead to a detrital magnetic remanence in those rock records. By measuring the directions in rock records, we can reconstruct the location of past Earth's magnetic north pole position under the assumption that the Earth magnetic field is dominated by a dipole. 

One of the primary methods of using paleomagnetic directional data to resolve temporal relationship between rock units is to compare paleomagnetic pole positions. Overlapping pole positions would imply similar age while distinct pole positions would indicate different ages. Such paleomagnetic test requires that Earth's magnetic field was dipolar and that paleosecular variation is averaged out. 

introduction to the GAD hypothesis
    Earth's magnetic field is the result of convective flow of liquid iron-alloy in Earth's outer core. At present day, the geodynamo is collectively powered by heat flow across the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and from the crystallization of the solid inner core from the liquid outer core which provides latent heat and compositional buoyancy due to the exclusion of light elements \cite{Buffett2000a}. Studies have found that a dynamo field has existed since at least 3.4 billion years ago \cite{Selkin2007a, Biggin2011a, Tarduno2014a, Brenner2020a}.
    
    dipole equation
    importance of averaging out paleosecular variation
    verified in the past 5 Myr
    the TK03 model developed using volcanic data in the past 5 myr
    north shore data has been shown to conform to such a model, suggesting a GAD dominated field similar to that of recent Cenozoic time scale ca. 1.1 Ga
    additionally, Pierce et al., we showed that detrital hematite bearing paleosol sedimentary rocks of the Midcontinent Rift bracketed by north shore volcanic lava flows using the TK03 model to correct for detrital remanence directions agrees very well to the lava flow directions. This also support a GAD field model during the Midcontinent Rift time.
    Additional paleomagnetic field tests that support a GAD dominated field include the reversal test in detailed stratigraphic context of Swanson-Hysell publications. 

while there are many paleomagnetic directional data in the late Mesoproterozoic, few high-quality paleomagnetic intensity data exist at the time. It is essential to obtain intensity data because they  help measure the strength of the geodynamo and are one of the only direct observational data that shed light into the thermal history of the Earth. With the timing of inner core nucleation still at debate due to large uncertainty in the physical properties of core materials including the thermal conductivity, theoretical calculations have difficulty differentiating whether Earth had a solid inner core since the primordial time or it formed later in the history. 


\subsection{Recovering deep time full-vector paleomagnetic records using silicate-hosted Fe-oxides}

The ferromagnetic minerals in rocks are the hosts to rocks' magnetic memories for billions of years. 

There is a wealth of paleomagnetic directional data from the Midcontinent Rift system, a vast geologic province covering much of the area around Lake Superior today and extends in two branches toward Kansas and Michigan. Protracted magmatism and subsequent failure in rifting ancient North America continent (Laurentia) apart resulted in a rich rock record in the rift that is well-preserved through the following billion years. \cite{Swanson-Hysell2019a} developed and compiled state-of-the-art paleomagnetic directional and high-precision geochronology data from the Midcontinent Rift which has become the central record of global paleogeography reconstruction in the late Mesoproterozoic Era \cite{Evans2021a}. However, 

To investigate the characterstics of Earth's geodynamo , I have developed both paleomagnetic directional and intensity data from the 1.1 billion-year-old anorthosite xenoliths of the Beaver Bay Complex in the Midcontinent Rift system that formed at the end of the Mesoproterozoic Era. I then develop paleomagnetic records from rocks in Death Valley and the Grand Canyon to provide another look at the Mesoproterozoic geomagneic field from a different location. 

In this dissertation I focus on exploring questions


While much of  the study and use of magnetic stones were for directional purposes, the modern scientific study of magnetism of ancient rocks, i.e. ``paleomagnetism" did not gain its momentum until the 20th century. Through the use of inclination data derived from oceanic crust, we know how plate tectonics operated and the relative motion of plates in the past ca. 200 Ma. With the use of full vector directional paleomagnetic data from older rocks on the continent, now we are able to recosntruction global paleogeography deeper back in time, and discovered that there have been times in Earth history where continents conjoined to form supercontinents. Furthermore, by reconstructing the intensity of the dipolar magnetic moment of the geomagnetic field through Earth history we are able to explore the evolution of Earth's thermal history as well as the change in its inner structure (e.g. the timing of existence of the inner core), which can help us better understand the formation of planets. 

While many topics are still in debate and better methods, and statistics are emerging to improve the statistics, we are in an era where enriching compilations of direction data and intensity data are marking exciting progress in understanding Earth history and understanding of planet formation. 

We are still in the debate of the birth timing of the inner core. 

related development in the study of magnetic material led to the invention of cassets tapes (a version of which google still use today for long-term data storage!). Recent years the study of electromagnetism has progressed from 3D bulk material to 2-dimensional materials. Recent discovery of altermagnetism as a new class of magnetic ordering keeps expanding our understanding of the fundamentals of the physical world and sheds new lights to material and theoretical development of the future. 

I find much joy in studying in depth the field of paleomagnetism while being exposed to related topics in material science through collaborations and daily interactions with colleagues. In the following part of the I will have a brief introduction about our understanding of Earth's geodynamo, the ways in which rocks may acquire paleomagnetic records, and they way I use those records to explore questions in Earth history in the following individual project-based chapters. 




4. With the GAD model we can reconstruct paleogeography in deep time before the earliest available seafloor magnetic data. 

5. The GAD model not only gives a quantitative relationship between paleolatitude and inclination, the dipole field model also given quantitative projection of surface field intensity and the geodynamo dipole moment. The measured field also has latitudinal dependency. By converting field intensity observations at a certain paleolatitude into paleodynamo dipole moments, this construct allows us to establish a record of the strength of geodynamo through Earth history and which can allow us to explore the evolution of the structure and thermal history of the interior of Earth through time. 


4. In the chapters of this thesis, I use paleomagnetic data developed from Mesoproterozoic rocks of the Midcontinent Rift to explore the paleogeography 


4. In \textbf{Chapter 2}, I develop paleomagnetic data from Mesoproterozoic-aged diabase and anorthosite xenoliths from the Midcontinent Rift that outcrop today along the stretch of the North Shore area to explore magmatic linkage between the intrusions and the Greenstone lava flow, a single lava flow up to 400 meters in thickness which outcrop along the Keweenaw Peninsula and Isle Royale. Only indirect evidence can be drawn since direct field relationship is covered by water and other rock units in the present-day basin of Lake Superior. I compare the paleomagnetic pole position recorded by the Beaver River diabase intrusions with that developed from the Greenstone flow to test the hypothesis that they are cogenetic from a temporal aspect.

Measurements of paleomagnetic remanence are used to develop paleolatitude constraints using the working hypothesis that the surface expression of Earth’s geomagnetic field averages out to a geocentric axial dipole (GAD) where the full vector can be decomposed into two orthogonal components where one points toward the center of the Earth. 
Redrawn after McElhinny (1973).

Of particular use is that under this dipole model the inclination of magnetization (I) is a simple function of latitude (λ) that can be determined using the “dipole equation”( Fig. 1.3)):
tan(I) = 2 tan(λ)

modern day observations show that Earth's magnetic field expressed on the surface is constantly changing but conforms to a dipole pattern with the poles overlapping with geographic poles if the observations are averaged over a long enough period of time. Statistical analyses have shown that 



The Proterozoic Eon is a important middle stage of Earth's 4.5 billion years of life with a distinct role that connects the preceeding Archean Eon when continental lithosphere start to emerge, and the following Phanerozoic Eon when multicellular life emerged and flourished on the planet. ancient pieces of cratons almagamated into the Proterozoic Laurentia craton, substantial evidence of modern-day style plate tectonics, surface evolution of eukaryotes, etc. The evolution through these 2 billion years culminated in a climatic extrema called Snowball Earth followed by the Cambrian period where life exploded. The rocks formed through magmatism bear information of deep Earth properties, the resultant lithospheric plate tectonic configurations set the stage for surface evolution. This dissertation focus on developing data that constrain the characteristics of the magmatism, paleogeography configurations in an improved chronological context.

This dissertation has a focus on the paleomagnetism and specifically using paleomagnetic records in rocks formed in the ancient north American continent to explore magmatic linkage between Beaver river diabase and the Greenstone flow and the implication for the scale and intensity of mafic magmatism in the Midcontinent Rift ca. 1.1 billion years ago; using anorthosite xenoliths to reconstruct the intensity of Earth's magnetic field 1.1 billion years ago and the implication for the strength of the geodynamo at the time, and the implications for the status of Earth's core---in relation to the Earth's thermal history; 

Learning from the work pioneered by Ian Rose, a former Ph.D. student at Berkeley EPS advised by Professor Bruce Buffett and Nick Swanson-Hysell who developed a Bayesian method 

during the time I worked with an undergraduate James Pierce on an hornors thesis project where we investigated how hematite-rich sedimentary rocks record paleomagnetic field directions and developed a method to represent uncertainties associated with inclination shallowing in such sedimentary record. 


\subsection{Dealing with sedimentary paleomagnetic data and representing uncertainties in inclination shallowing}

Moving from a rich record of paleomagnetic data especially provided by the well-preserved Midcontinent Rift, we have a lull in well-dated paleomagnetic data in the $\sim$300 Myr afterwards, until the ca. 775 Ma Gunbarrel dikes (as compiled in \cite{Eyster2019a}). We have to use sedimentary rocks when there is a lack of igneous poles. 

The Jacosbville Formation is a good candidate as it is post-rift sedimentary formation in the rift that has been well preserved. With recent exposure as the Oronto Group has been dated to have beginning of exposure since the retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet. However, to be able to use sedimentary data in paleomagnetic pole compilation requires sedimentary rock-specific statistical tools as there are distinctions between uncertainties associated with sedimentary paleomagnetic directional data. In igneous rocks, directional data uncertainties are typically considered to be sourced from spherically randomly distributed error introduced during sample handling throughout the experimental procedures and can be propagated through the spherical Fisher statistics \cite{Fisher1953a}. In sedimentary rocks, rotation of magnetic grains during deposition and post-formational compaction process has been found to cause apparent shallowing in the recorded inclinations with respect to the inclinations of the geomagnetic fields they were deposited in. Such phenomenon is known as the ``inclination shallowing" and has been demonstrated experimentally through redeposition process of clastic sedimentary rocks. 

Through an undergraduate summer research project and through mentoring an undergraduate honors thesis project, I collaborated with James Pierce in 2022 and published a manuscript named ``Quantifying Inclination Shallowing and Representing Flattening Uncertainty in Sedimentary Paleomagnetic Poles" in \textit{Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems} where proposed using the spherical bivariate Kent distribution to represent uncertainties associated with inclination shallowing in sedimentary rocks. 

This new tool has been used in the following reserach work coming out from our group, including \cite{Slotznick2023a} and \cite{Zhang2024a}.
